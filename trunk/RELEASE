$VERSION

- Moved completions from ./completions/complete*/* to ./complete*/*
- comp_include() now checks each directory of $COMP_PATH for "./include/file"
  instead of doing a single check for "$COMP_DIR/include/file".
- Moved functions from completionrc to separate include files:
  _filedir_xspec, _get_cword (Issue 30).





bash_completion_lib-1.2.9, 21-Jan-2009

- Fixed argument completion of ifup/ifdown (Issue 5).
- Moved functions from completionrc to separate include files:
  _configured_interfaces, _filedir, _rl_enabled (Issue 30).
- Allow perl completion to complete filenames, complete -I and -x arguments (Issue 5).
- Fixed error message in ssh/scp -F completion: "option -F requires argument".
- Add find -wholename completion (Issue 5).
- Handle whitespaces in $HOME for _known_hosts() completion (Issue 5).
- Allow ssh/scp configfile to contain spaces.
- Improved _known_hosts to allow GlobalKnownHostsFile and UserKnownHostsFile to
  contain multiple subsequent spaces.




bash_completion_lib-1.2.8, 31-Oct-2008

- Fix loading completionrc once (1.2.7 bug)
- Added handling of option `-F configfile' to ssh completion and _known_hosts
- Exclude hashed hostnames from ssh host completion results (Issue 5).
- Allow indented ssh config settings `GlobalKnownHostFile', `UserKnownHostFile'
  and `HostName' in _known_hosts completion.
- Added handling of option `-F configfile' to scp completion (Issue 36).
- Fixed _known_hosts completion offering `Name' of `HostName' as completion
  (Issue 37)
- Added ssh/scp/_known_hosts improvements from latest bash-completion debian
  source: http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org/




bash_completion_lib-1.2.7, 4-Oct-2008

- Completed patches of 20060301-0ubuntu1 (Issue 3).
- kpdf: Complete postscript files (Issue 3).
- kdvi: complete .*\.dvi\.(gz|bz2) (Issue 3).
- evince: Autocomplete on cbr/cbz/djvu files (Issue 3).
- Fixed and improved support for apt-get, apt-cache, apt-build and aptititude
  (Issue 3, 32).
- Prevent bash_completion_lib from sourcing twice.  If `COMP_VERSION' is
  non-empty, bash_completion_lib returns immediately without loading any
  completions (Issue 3, 31).




bash_completion_lib-1.2.6, 21-Sep-2008

- Removed unused function `comp_load_and_install()' (Issue 24).
- Added administrative application `bcl' (Issue 28).
- Usage of the COMP_LIB array is deprecated, because an array can't be exported
  to a subshell.  Upon `bash_completion_lib' invocation, the COMP_LIB array is
  automatically converted to a colon-delimited (:) string named COMP_PATH.
  Exporting COMP_PATH is necessary for the administrative application `bcl' to
  work correctly.




bash_completion_lib-1.2.5, 4-Sep-2008

- Added 'versions' environment variables COMP_VERSION and COMP_CACHE_VERSION;
  automatically clear cache if versions differ (Issue 26).
- Fixed error message "No such file or directory" when COMP_CACHE points to a
  non-existing file (Issue 27).




bash_completion_lib-1.2.4, 3-Aug-2008

- Automated calls to `comp_install' and first call to completions generation
  (Issue 23).
- Fixed tests to use sync_after_int() instead of individually sending ^C'




bash_completion_lib-1.2.3, 1-Aug-2008

- Within comp_load(), when relocating the completion, fixed removing from the
  leftmost dot instead of the rightmost dot.
- Improved tests.  Added test.




bash_completion_lib-1.2.2, 1-Aug-2008

- Moved default location of COMP_CACHE to ~/.bash_completion_lib.d/cache~ (was
  ~/.bash_completion_lib~)




bash_completion_lib-1.2.1, 1-Aug-2008

- Turned COMP_LIB into array variable, allowing for local completion overrides
  (Issue 20).  If COMP_LIB is unset, COMP_LIB defaults to array:
  - ~/.bash_completion_lib.d/completions
  - $COMP_DIR/completions
- Fixed tests to run successful on Cygwin/Windows




bash_completion_lib-1.2.0, 20-Jul-2008

- Changed symlink-ignore character from dot (.) to exclamation mark (!) to be
  able to run bash_completion_lib on Cygwin/Windows
- Fixed tests to run successful on Cywgin/Windows
- Fixed passing argument $1 to _longopt
- Changed _dpkg-reconfigure to _dpkg_reconfigure to comply to POSIX
- Fixed calling `_iwpriv' instead of `_add_members' upon first
  completion of `iwpriv'
- Added `comp_include _known_hosts' to completion of `webmitm' and `sshmitm'
- Fixed passing argument $1 to _ypmatch

  iwpriv, iwspy, cc, ant
- Fixed error message when completing `rcs': "bash: [: too many arguments"




bash_completion_lib-1.0.1, 16-Jun-2008

- Within comp_load(), looked for `comp_install' instead of `_filedir' as test
  whether to include `completionrc' in comp_load(), because `_filedir' is
  already defined by original bash_completion.




bash_completion_lib-1.0.0, 15-Jun-2008

- 100% of bash_completion-20060301-4 (Debian) completions are now added
