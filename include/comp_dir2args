# Convert directory to completion arguments.  If a directory starts with
# 'complete-', the file .complete will be included.  This file is supposed
# to set the global variable 'COMP_ARGS'.
# @param $1  Directory.  Must include at least one slash and start with "complete", e.g.:
#	     ./complete -o nospace
#	     /home/joe/completions/complete -o filenames
# @result exit	True (0) if completion must be installed, False (> 0) if
#     not.  Global 'COMP_ARGS' contains the arguments to pass to 'complete'
#     NOTE: Global 'COMP_ARGS' is used instead of echo-ing the string
#	    to stdout, because this saves us invoking a subshell, thus
#	    gains us speed.
